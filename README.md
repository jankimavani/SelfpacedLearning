# SelfpacedLearning

Introduction

Self-paced learning is an adaptable teaching strategy that enables students to pick up new knowledge and abilities to learn without the help of anybody. Students are free to select their study times and locations, move through the course material according to what they understand, and go over the material again as needed. It encourages self-motivation, covers a wide range of topics and abilities, offers online resources, and can issue diplomas and assessments upon completion. Self-paced learning cultivates a culture of ongoing skill improvement and self-discipline.
